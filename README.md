# NPC Poison/Venom Tracker
Highlights attackable NPCs that have been inflicted with Poison or Venom by the player. The highlight is removed when the NPC dies/despawns.

Use case would be for account builds that don't want to re-poison/re-venom NPCs that are already inflicted in order to limit combat XP.
